git rebase -i - does an interactive rebase
    An example how to use it:
    1) create a branch b1 and commit a feature f1
    2) create a second branch b2 on top of it and commit a feature f2
    3) switch to the branch b1 and make several changes in different commits
    4) switch back to the b2 and do an interactive re-base against a master branch:
       -> git rebase -i master
    5) during an interactive re-base several commits made on step 3) might be melted into one
